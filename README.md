# AI Models Necessary to Reduce Racism in Criminal Justice In The USA
With technology advancing rapidly, AI has found its way in the US's criminal justice system, largely in the form of facial recognition. Oftentimes, these AIs need data to be trained in recognizing a face. With a disproportionate amount of people of color in being incarcered and/or processed through the criminal justice system, the training often becomes skewed against POCs. This has led to the unintentional side effect of misidentification among POCs and the model often matches individuals and suspects, regardless of race, to people of color within the police database. The AI models in this repository take in data and find out the error percentage of misidentified POCs and provides a more comprehensive review of the data.
